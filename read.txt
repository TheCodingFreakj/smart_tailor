Idea: "Personalized Product Recommendations App"
Description: A Shopify app that provides merchants with personalized product recommendations for their customers, increasing upselling and cross-selling opportunities. The app uses machine learning to analyze customer behavior, purchase history, and browsing patterns to recommend products in real-time.

Features:
Personalized Recommendations:

Suggests products based on customer's browsing history, purchase patterns, and preferences.
Offers dynamic product bundles for upselling (e.g., "Frequently Bought Together").
Customizable Widgets:

Merchants can customize how recommendations appear on their store (e.g., slider, grid, or a dedicated page).
Widgets can be embedded on the homepage, product pages, or cart page.
Analytics Dashboard:

Displays metrics like conversion rates, average order value (AOV) increase, and top-performing recommendations.
AI-Driven Insights:

Uses machine learning to identify trends and recommend inventory adjustments.
Suggests new products that align with customer interests.
Multi-Language Support:

Offers translation capabilities to fit stores in various locales.
Integration with Email Marketing:

Generates personalized recommendation emails to re-engage customers.
Tech Stack:
